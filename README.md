# Book Store
------From my Data Structures Course------

Dialog during the projects progression:
In this project we use DLL to find a certain book (whether it is available or not) and have
it purchased. One can also store a book with the use of ISBN, title, author and cost.
This project is supposed to help us practice with DLL and node pointing.
