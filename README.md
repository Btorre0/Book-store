# Book Store
From my Data Structures Course:
In this project we use DLL to find a certain book (whether it is available or not) and have
it purchased. One can also store a book with the use ISBN, title, author and cost.
This project is supposed to help us practice with DLL. But being honest here! I hate it. I 
have been working on this project for three weeks and found it extremely challenging.

"A dynamic link library (DLL) is a collection of small programs that larger programs can load when needed to complete specific tasks. The small program, called a DLL file, contains instructions that help the larger program handle what may not be a core function of the original program."

## Install and Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd project-2-book-store-dll-adapter-Btorre0
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   If your project has dependencies, install them. For example, if you are using Python and have a `requirements.txt` file, run:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you are using Node.js and have a `package.json` file, run:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Code:**
   Execute the main script or start the application. For example, if your main script is `main.py`:

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

   Or if you are using Node.js:

   ```sh
   node main.js
   ```

5. **Run Tests:**
   If you have unit tests, run them to ensure everything is working correctly. For example, if you are using Python's `unittest`:

   ```sh
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

   Or if you are using a testing framework like Jest for Node.js:

   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

6. **Check Output:**
   Verify the output in the terminal or any other output medium specified by your project.
